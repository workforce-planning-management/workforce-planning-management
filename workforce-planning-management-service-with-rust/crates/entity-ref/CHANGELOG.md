# Changelog

All notable changes to this crate are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/)
and this project follows [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

> See also: [README.md](./README.md) — user-facing intro. This crate has no
> `spec/`, `AGENTS.md`, or `CLAUDE.md` — it is a small, single-file value-type
> crate; the rustdoc in `src/lib.rs` plus this file and the README are the
> complete documentation surface.

## [Unreleased]

### Fixed — README drift (ER-1, ER-3) + missing manifest `readme` field (ER-4)

- **ER-1**: "Who actually consumes this" was stale at eight crates;
  `care-pathway-service-with-loco` is a ninth (and ships its own
  `EdgeKind::ContinuesAs` journey-edge origination, 2026-08-24) but
  wasn't listed. Updated the count and narrative.
- **ER-3**: the "## Types" table's `EdgeKind` row named five kinds,
  omitting `continues_as` (added 2026-08-24); the `EntityType` row
  elided `care_pathway_instance`/`patient_flow_stay` behind "…". Both
  rows now name every `EntityType::ALL`/`EdgeKind::ALL` member. New
  `readme_types_table_names_every_entity_type_and_edge_kind` unit test
  (`include_str!`s `README.md`) pins this so it can't silently drift
  behind a future registry addition again.
- **ER-4**: `Cargo.toml` had no `readme` field, so the published
  crates.io page showed only the one-line `description`. Added
  `readme = "README.md"`; `cargo package --list` now includes it.

### Added — cargo-fuzz harness (SEC-I2)

- A `fuzz/` [`cargo-fuzz`](https://rust-fuzz.github.io/book/) crate with
  three coverage-guided libFuzzer targets. This crate is small and pure,
  which is exactly why it is worth fuzzing: it is a **parser eight other
  crates depend on**, reached from a stored `TEXT` column and from
  request bodies naming a record in another service.
  - `parse_ref` — `EntityRef::from_str` over arbitrary UTF-8:
    never-panic, plus the **round-trip** invariant (anything that parses
    must `Display` back to something that re-parses to the identical
    value). A `Display`/parse asymmetry here would repoint an edge at a
    different record rather than fail loudly.
  - `deserialize_ref` — the `#[serde(try_from = "String")]` path via
    `serde_json`, which is the entry point real callers use, plus
    serialize → deserialize equality.
  - `registry_tokens` — the closed `EntityType` / `EdgeKind` token
    registries: `from_token` accepts only registry members and
    round-trips, `is_symmetric` agrees with `inverse`, and `permits` is
    order-symmetric for a symmetric kind.
- Nightly only, so the sub-crate is exempt from the repository MSRV. See
  `fuzz/README.md`.

### Added — Criterion benchmarks

- `benches/entity_ref.rs`. These are tiny operations that run at graph
  scale — the aggregator parses two refs per edge row — so the benchmark
  covers parse (hit, worst-case registry lookup, and each reject path),
  `Display`, the serde bridge, a whole page of rows with
  `Throughput::Elements`, and the edge-kind registry lookups.

### Added — declared MSRV (Rust 1.96)

- `Cargo.toml` now declares `rust-version = "1.96"`, the repository's
  **current stable minus two** floor
  (`spec/rust-msrv-n-minus-2/index.md`). Sourced from `ci/msrv.txt` and
  enforced by `scripts/ci-check.sh msrv`, which asserts the declared
  value matches that file and then compiles the crate — `--all-targets`,
  so benches and tests count — against the 1.96 toolchain. Behaviour is
  unchanged; what changes is that the floor is now a checked claim
  rather than an unstated assumption. *(Corrected 2026-09-06: this entry
  originally said 1.95 / N-3, matching the policy at the time it was
  written; the repository-wide MSRV policy has since tightened to N-2,
  and `Cargo.toml` already declares 1.96 — this entry is edited in place,
  since it was still `[Unreleased]`, rather than left to misstate the
  crate's actual floor.)*

## [0.2.0] - 2026-08-05

> Reconstructed 2026-08-04 (DOC-5) from `git log` — this crate previously
> shipped with no `CHANGELOG.md` at all.

### Added

- Supply-chain scanning: `deny.toml` (RUSTSEC advisories, a permissive-
  license allow-list, warn-level bans/sources) and
  `.github/workflows/security.yml` (`cargo deny check` on push / PR /
  weekly cron), matching the family-wide SEC-I1 rollout. No behaviour
  change.

### Changed

- Bumped `uuid` `1.23` → `1.24`. No behaviour change.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-08

### Added

- **Inaugural release.** The shared cross-service-linking contract
  (`agents/share/cross-service-linking.md` §3, §9) — rollout step 1
  ("land the contracts; no behaviour yet"):
  - `EntityType` — the ten globally-unique entity discriminators
    (`person`, `worker`, `organization`, `case`, `place`, `thing`,
    `event`, `course`, `courseinstance`, `care_pathway`), with `as_str`,
    `from_token`, and the `service()` map (`course` and `courseinstance`
    both resolve to `course-service`, since a multi-entity service is
    why the ref encodes the *type*, not the service).
  - `EntityRef` — `{entity_type, id: Uuid}`, parsing / `Display` /
    serde as the single URN string `"<entity_type>:<uuid>"` (one
    indexable `TEXT` column), via `FromStr` and
    `TryFrom<String>`/`Into<String>`.
  - `ParseEntityRefError` — `Malformed` / `UnknownType` / `BadId`; no
    panics on any input.
  - `EdgeKind` — the closed v1 edge-kind registry (`same_identity`,
    `works_at`, `member_of`, `employed_by`, `subject_of`) with
    `is_symmetric`, `is_temporal`, `inverse`, `sensitivity`, and
    `permits(from, to)` endpoint-type validation.
  - `Sensitivity` — `Medium` / `High` (`subject_of` is the sole `High`
    kind, per §10's `case ↔ person` governance).
  - `#![forbid(unsafe_code)]`, `#![deny(missing_docs)]`,
    `#![warn(clippy::pedantic)]`; dependency-light (`serde`, `uuid`,
    `thiserror`). Unit tests plus a doctest cover URN round-tripping,
    every `EntityType` token, the `course`/`courseinstance` shared-
    service mapping, malformed/unknown-type/bad-UUID rejection, the
    serde wire form, and the registry's endpoint-permission rules.
