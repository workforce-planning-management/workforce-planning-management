//! Attribute-based access control (ABAC) — the family's shared
//! authorization engine.
//!
//! Implements the policy model fixed by
//! [`agents/share/authorization-attributes.md`] (§2–§5): a decision is a
//! pure evaluation of an ordered rule list over the **subject
//! attributes** carried in the verified [`Claims::attrs`] map, the
//! derived **action** ([`Action`]), the coarse **resource** (the entity
//! name), and — for services that load the target record or supply
//! request context — optional **record-level resource attributes**
//! (`resource.*`) and **environment attributes** (`env.*`) matched by
//! prefixed `when` keys (§9–§10; see [`Policy::evaluate_with_context`]).
//! A `when` value of `$sub` / `$email` is a template resolving to the
//! caller's identity, so a rule can express ownership. First match wins;
//! when no rule matches, the default decision is **allow read, deny
//! everything else**. An allow rule may attach **obligations** (e.g.
//! `"mask"`, `"audit"`) that the [`Decision`] carries for the
//! enforcement point to honour — the engine does not interpret them.
//!
//! The engine is pure data + pure evaluation: no I/O, no clock, no
//! panics on any input. Nine entity services embed it inside their
//! blanket `/api/*` guards so the family shares one tested
//! implementation instead of nine copies.
//!
//! # Example
//!
//! ```
//! use authentication_verifier::{Action, Claims, Policy};
//! use std::collections::BTreeMap;
//!
//! // Subject attributes as minted by the auth-service into the token.
//! let mut attrs = BTreeMap::new();
//! attrs.insert("access".to_string(), vec!["write".to_string()]);
