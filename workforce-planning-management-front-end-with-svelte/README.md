# Workforce Planning Management — SvelteKit front-end

The browser client for the
[Loco JSON API sibling](../workforce-planning-management-service-with-rust/):
HR, manager, and employee self-service views over the full
employment lifecycle — hiring boards, onboarding, time and leave,
rotas, the employee record and org chart, reviews, training,
succession, payroll runs, and salary benchmarking.

> ⚠️ **Demo software.** Not a production HR system; synthetic data
> only. See [spec/regulatory](../spec/regulatory.md).

**Status: implemented (WPM-T18/T19, 2026-07-18).** svelte-check
clean; 5 vitest + 4 Playwright tests pass (`page.route`-stubbed —
runs without the Rust service). Quick start: `pnpm install &&
pnpm dev` (expects the Loco sibling on :5150; `pnpm test` /
`pnpm exec playwright test`).
