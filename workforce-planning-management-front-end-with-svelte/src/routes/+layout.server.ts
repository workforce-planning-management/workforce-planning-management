// Root sign-in gate (WPM-T38): every page except the public
// sign-in/verify routes requires a session. Before this, a visitor
// with no `locals.sessionId` reached every page — profile, payroll,
// wellbeing, all of them — and only discovered they were signed out
// once an API call silently failed through the BFF proxy, rather than
// being redirected up front.
//
// Gated at the root (not per-mutation-page, unlike person-front-end's
// narrower guard): WPM's pages mix read content with embedded actions
// (the retention sweep button on `/privacy`, payroll lifecycle actions
// on `/payroll/[id]`, …) rather than separating reads and writes onto
// dedicated routes, so there is no small "mutation-only" subset to
// gate instead.
//
// `locals.sessionId` is presence-only (set from the httpOnly cookie in
// `hooks.server.ts`, never re-validated here) — a UX convenience in
// front of the backend's real ABAC enforcement, not a substitute for
// it, matching the family's `requireSignedIn` convention.
